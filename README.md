This project contains a GoogleMapFragment which can be added to an activity with a valid location request.
Map events like onMapClick etc are added.
Has a MapHelper to get address,place marker etc.
Latest Location Api is used to get Users location.

All you got to do is add the fragment to the activity, it will automatically handle gps availabilty.

There is a sample activity , please refer it to understand more.
Would really like contributions to this because there is so much more related to maps.
